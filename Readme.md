Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd gui
  yarn start

Happy hacking!
